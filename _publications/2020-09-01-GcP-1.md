excerpt: 'Google App Engine is an integrated cloud-based solution designed to provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) system and automate business or organizational processes while meeting implicit requirements such as security, reliability, and automated scalability. Google App Engine lets developers build scalable web and mobile applications and deploy them without having to worry about underlying infrastructure. In mobile cloud computing the apps that run on mobile devices are actually deployed on cloud while mobile computing run native apps. Users subscribe to applications available on the Google Cloud Platform and access remotely stored data from nearest data centers or from most available resource at a given point of time. This ensures high availability to the end users who request the service.'
